# CCNA Packet Tracer Labs – Networking Fundamentals

This project contains a series of hands-on labs I built using **Cisco Packet Tracer** while learning core networking concepts. These labs were part of my foundational training to support my career path in **penetration testing** and **cybersecurity**.

Although my focus is on offensive security, I believe that understanding how networks function at the protocol level is essential for identifying misconfigurations, bypassing defenses, and performing deeper network analysis. These labs helped me build that knowledge step-by-step through real scenarios.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Each lab explores a different topic in networking, from basic configuration to more advanced routing protocols. Here's a breakdown of what I covered:

### 🔁 Routing Protocols

- **Static Routing** – Manual path setup for simple networks.
- **RIP** – Basic dynamic routing using hop count.
- **EIGRP** – Efficient distance-vector routing with faster convergence.
- **OSPF** – Scalable link-state protocol suitable for large networks.
- **BGP** – Exterior routing used on the internet between ISPs.

### 🏠 LAN & IP Services

- **Default Routing** – Routing strategy for stub networks.
- **DHCP** – Automating IP address assignment.
- **Syslog** – Logging device activity for monitoring and auditing.
- **NTP** – Time synchronization across network devices.
- **TFTP** – Transferring configs and images between devices.

### 🔐 Access Control & NAT

- **ACLs** – Filtering traffic using standard and extended rules.
- **Static NAT** – One-to-one IP mapping.
- **Dynamic NAT** – Pool-based translation of internal addresses.

## 📄 CCNA Cheat Sheet (Work-in-Progress)

I've also started creating a **CCNA Cheat Sheet** that summarizes key commands, configurations, and concepts used in each lab. It’s currently about **70–80% complete**, and I plan to finish and refine it soon.

The goal is to have a quick-reference guide that reinforces what I’ve practiced and can help others reviewing this repository understand each lab more easily.

## 💼 Why This Matters for Cybersecurity

A strong understanding of networking helps in many areas of penetration testing and security assessment:

- Tracing network paths and identifying attack surfaces
- Recognizing and exploiting routing or NAT misconfigurations
- Testing firewall rules and ACL behavior
- Pivoting between systems during lateral movement

These labs gave me the context and confidence to approach real-world network environments with a security mindset.

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer v8.2+**
- Networking devices: Routers, switches, end hosts, and servers

## 📁 Folder Contents

This repo includes `.pkt` files (Packet Tracer labs) and the in-progress **CCNA_Cheat_Sheet.pdf**. Each `.pkt` file includes a saved lab with complete configuration.

## 📌 Note

All labs were created and tested manually. No automation tools were used — just practice, learning, and troubleshooting through trial and error. The cheat sheet is still in progress, and I'll be updating it regularly.
