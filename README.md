# CCNA Packet Tracer Labs – Networking Fundamentals

Welcome to my collection of Cisco Packet Tracer labs, created while learning and applying core networking concepts as part of my foundational training for ethical hacking and penetration testing.

While my primary goal is to work in the field of cybersecurity and penetration testing, I strongly believe that **solid networking knowledge is essential** for any cybersecurity professional. These labs demonstrate my hands-on practice with routers, switches, protocols, and network design using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## 🧠 What I Learned

Each lab in this repository explores an essential networking concept or configuration. Here’s a summary of what I worked on:

### 🔁 Routing Protocols

- **Static Routing** – Manually configured routes for small networks.
- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)** – Distance vector protocol basics.
- **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)** – Advanced distance vector protocol for dynamic routing.
- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** – Link-state routing protocol with scalable area-based design.
- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** – Inter-domain routing protocol used on the internet.

### 🏠 LAN & IP Services

- **Default Routing** – Simplified routing for stub networks.
- **DHCP Configuration** – Automatic IP address allocation.
- **Syslog** – Centralized logging for network monitoring.
- **NTP (Network Time Protocol)** – Time synchronization across devices.
- **TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)** – Transferring configurations and IOS images.

### 🔐 Access Control & NAT

- **ACLs (Access Control Lists)** – Basic and extended filtering of traffic.
- **Static NAT** – One-to-one IP address translation.
- **Dynamic NAT** – Many-to-many address translation using a NAT pool.

## 💼 Why This Matters for Cybersecurity

- Understanding **network paths** helps in **network reconnaissance and pivoting** during penetration tests.
- Knowing how routing and protocols work enables **bypassing firewalls** or **exploiting misconfigurations**.
- Practical exposure to ACLs and NAT is critical for **identifying and testing security controls**.

## 📌 Note

This is a learning project. All labs were created manually without automation. Each concept has been tested and validated.
